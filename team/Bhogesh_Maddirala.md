I am a senior Informatics major. I have several years of experience in Java, but since 2018,
I have mostly worked in Python (includes Pandas) and Javascript. Furthermore, I have worked with the storyboard on swift 
and basic user interface. I have picked up HTML/CSS pretty well so I am comfortable doing that. I keep praticing python and java,
so I am gradually improving my skills.
